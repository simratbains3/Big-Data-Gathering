Genetic Algorithm based approach to determine optimal collection points for Big Data Gathering in Distributed Sensor Networks
Energy- efficient data gathering in densely distributed sensor networks is a demanding area of research. Among the various techniques of data acquisition, the mobile sink approach is highly suitable in densely distributed sensor networks. The clustering-based Expectation Minimization technique proposed by Takaish et al. is an efficient approach to minimize the energy consumption of sensors while maintaining the node coverage. However, clustering of nodes may not ensure an optimal trajectory of mobile sink node. In this project, we use genetic algorithm based approach to optimally select the data gathering points that minimize the distance of mobile sink trajectory to improve data collection time.
